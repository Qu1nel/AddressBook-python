# AddressBook-python
A simple console project (task) from the book "Byte of Python" is implemented without BD and more. Only use the 'pickle' module and OOP.

To work with the application, follow the instructions in the program.

There is no need for additional modules other than those built into Python 3.10, the program runs out of the box.

***Requirements: Python 3.10+ version.***
