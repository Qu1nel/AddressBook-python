# AddressBook-python
A simple console project (task) from the book "Byte of Python" is implemented without BD and more. Only use the 'pickle' module and OOP.

The principle of operation is simple. There are several files, there is a "contact database" (a binary package file) in which all contacts are stored. "Communication" with the application consists in choosing the digits 0...9 (or words and their abbreviations).

There is no need for additional modules other than those built into Python 3.10, the program runs out of the box

***Requirements: Python 3.10+ version.***
