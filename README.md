# AddressBook-python
A simple console project (task) from the book "Byte of Python" is implemented without BD and more. Only use the 'pickle' module and OOP.

The principle of operation is simple. There is one file, there is a "contact database" (a binary pickle file) that stores all contacts. "Communication" with the application consists in choosing the digits 0...9 (or words and their abbreviations).

There is no need for additional modules other than those built into Python 3.10, the program runs out of the box

***Requirements: Python 3.10+ version.***
